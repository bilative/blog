## BLOGS
I write blogs at SistersLab and Medium.
- The blogs I write in SistersLab are written as a series of articles. And the frequency of the series are 1 month.
    - So far I have done "Data visualization series" and this series is finished.
    - The topic of the current article series is Web Scraping.
* Actually I have only 1 article on Medium. But I plan to add some more about data engineering projects.
